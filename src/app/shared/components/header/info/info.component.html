        <span>Welcome to the help page for <span class="blueColor">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
            management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="blueColor">Join</span> is, how it can
            benefit you, and how to use it.</span><br><br>
        <h2>What is <span class="blueColor ">Join</span>?</h2>
        <span><span class="blueColor">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
            group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="blueColor">Join</span> leverages the
            principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
            interface.<br><br> It is important to note that <span class="blueColor">Join</span> is designed as an
            educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best
            possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other

        <h2>How to use it</h2>

        <div class="list">
            <p>1.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                <span>When you log in to <span class="blueColor">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                    represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback”
                    and "Done".</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list">
            <p>2.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                <span>In <span class="blueColor">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                    to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
                    these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list">
            <p>3.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
                    the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list">
            <p>4.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping the card from one list to another.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="list">
            <p>5.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                <span>Deleting Cards Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                    cards, as this action is irreversible.<br><br> Remember that using <span

                    ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.<br><br> Have more questions about <span
